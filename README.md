# MulbotFramework

This is firmware based on marlin for my [[Mulbot](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3432384)]

Original design is used RAMPS 1.4 for the main board. But I burned out my mega2560.

Therefore I used Anycubic [[TRIGORILLA](https://www.amazon.com/ANYCUBIC-TriGorilla-Integrated-Compatible-Controller/dp/B079GRJH6V/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=trigorilla&qid=1554802824&s=gateway&sr=8-2)] for my Mulbot. This board is compatible with Mega2560 & RAMPS1.4. But I don't test it on RAMPS 1.5.

You can search "Mulbot" on facebook, join us and discuss with us.
